# Watcher

Watcher tracks referrer page, IP address, date/time and user agent data before discreetly redirecting to the indended URL.

# Setup

## Hosting

PHP has a [built-in web server](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) which can be used to spin up a server immediately for testing purposes.

    $ git clone https://github.com/safesploit/Watcher.git
    $ cd Watcher
    $ php -S localhost:8080 index.php
    
We can now access Watcher via `http://localhost:8080`
    
## URL Formatting

Using the GET variable `s` we can specify the header address to redirect the user to.

    http://localhost:8080/index.php?s=safesploit.com
    
Watcher will log information in `log.txt` and then redirect the user to `http://google.com`.

Alternatively the shorter form `http://localhost:8080/?s=safesploit.com` can be used.

# Example log

`Logged IP address: 127.0.0.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.0.0 Safari/537.36  Reffered by:  Parameter: safesploit.com Date logged: Friday 29th 2022f July 2022 07:33:38 PM`

## Watcher v1.1.0 
Since v1.1.0 full URLs can be provided via the `s` parameter without significant issue

`Logged IP address: 127.0.0.1, User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/103.0.0.0 Safari/537.36, Referred by: , Parameter: https://www.safesploit.com, Date logged: Saturday 30th 2022f July 2022 05:56:57 PM`

The supplied URL is as follows:

    http://localhost:8080/index.php?s=https://www.safesploit.com


## Potential Issues
Because `www.safesploit.com` will redirect HTTP request to HTTPS the code logic `header( "Location: http://" . $_GET['s'], TRUE, 301 )` works fine.

But for web servers which only use HTTPS and do not redirect HTTP requests issues will occur.
